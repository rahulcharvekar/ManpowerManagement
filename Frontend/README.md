- `GET /api/worker/applications` - Get worker's applications

### Employer API  
- `POST /api/jobs` - Create new job postings
- `GET /api/employer/jobs` - Get employer's job postings
- `GET /api/applications/{jobId}` - Get applications for a job

### Board API
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all platform users
- `GET /api/admin/analytics` - Get system analytics
- `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}` - Update user status

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing:

### âœ¨ **Benefits**
- **Utility-First**: Build complex designs with small, composable utility classes
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in responsive modifiers (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- **Custom Design System**: Extended color palette and animations for brand consistency
- **Developer Experience**: IntelliSense support and faster development

### ðŸŽ¨ **Custom Configuration**
The project includes a custom Tailwind configuration with:
- **Extended Color Palette**: Primary, secondary, success, warning, and danger color schemes
- **Custom Animations**: Fade-in, slide-up, and bounce-in animations
- **Custom Components**: Pre-built component classes using `@apply` directive

### ðŸ“± **Responsive Breakpoints**
- `sm:` - 640px and up
- `md:` - 768px and up  
- `lg:` - 1024px and up
- `xl:` - 1280px and up

### ðŸ”§ **Usage Examples**
```jsx
// Responsive grid
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">

// Custom button with hover effects
<button className="btn-primary hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow">

// Animated card
<div className="card animate-fade-in hover:transform hover:-translate-y-1">
```

## Development Notes

- The current implementation uses mock data for demonstration purposes
- Replace mock data with actual API calls when integrating with a backend
- Component state management is handled with React hooks
- Form validation and error handling are implemented throughout
- Responsive design ensures compatibility across device sizes
- Tailwind CSS classes provide consistent styling and responsive behavior
