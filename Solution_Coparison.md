| **Approach 1: Licensed ERP Core + Custom Build (Single Unified System)**           | Purchase a **licensed ERP core module** (e.g., accounting, inventory, taxation logic) and **build your own custom functionality** (UI, operations, workflows) over it. You own the full stack, but core logic is licensed. |
| **Approach 2: Custom Ops + External System like Tally (Two Disconnected Systems)** | Build your **custom operations layer**, and **integrate loosely** with a standalone accounting system like **Tally** via import/export or APIs. Two distinct systems.                                                      |

### 🔍 **Evaluation Across Key Dimensions**

| Criteria                      | **Approach 1: ERP Core Licensed + Custom Build**                               | **Approach 2: Custom Ops + External Core (Tally etc.)**      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initial Cost**              | 💸 **Medium-High** (License cost + dev cost)                                   | 💸 **Low-Medium** (Tally is cheaper, less dev needed)        |
| **Time to Market**            | ⏱️ **Moderate** – faster than full custom, slower than plug-and-play           | ⏱️ **Fast** – minimal effort to integrate and launch         |
| **Manpower**                  | 👨‍💻 **Medium to High** – need team to build ops logic + extend licensed core | 👨‍💻 **Low** – mainly ops dev and integration               |
| **Customization Flexibility** | 🛠️ **High** – tightly coupled custom modules with ERP core                    | ⚙️ **Limited** – must work around Tally constraints          |
| **Maintenance Overhead**      | 🧰 **Medium** – you control stack, but updates from ERP vendor must be managed | 🧰 **Low** – Tally handles most updates                      |
| **Integration Complexity**    | 🔗 **Low** – single stack, tightly integrated                                  | 🔗 **High** – syncing, reconciliation, error handling needed |
| **Compliance Responsibility** | ✅ **Shared** – core logic vendor keeps compliant, you own ops flow             | ✅ **Delegated** – Tally fully handles compliance             |
| **Vendor Lock-in Risk**       | ⚠️ **Moderate** – locked to ERP vendor’s updates and licensing                 | ⚠️ **High** – highly dependent on Tally workflows            |
| **Scalability**               | 📈 **High** – can scale ops + data in one system                               | 📉 **Medium** – limited by Tally API/storage/performance     |
| **Auditing / Reporting**      | 📊 **Integrated** – data lives in one place; audit-ready                       | 📊 **Fragmented** – may require manual reconciliation        |
